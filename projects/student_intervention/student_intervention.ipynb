In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "1) Decision Trees\n",
    "    With a little bit of research, I found this website (http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html) that brings a lot of real-world applications that were published between the years of 1993 and 1995 (a little bit old now but it is something). That gives us a notion that it can really be used for a lot things.\n",
    "    The Decision Tree model has as advantage of being a graphical representation of the problem, so it can be visualized. That makes it simpler to understand. Not only that but also has the advantage of being capable to work not only with numerical data but also with categorical data.\n",
    "    Some of the disadvantages of that type of model are: it can generate really complex trees that would make the model to overfit; As Safavian and Landgrebe say in [1], errors may accumulate from level to level.\n",
    "    This model is a good choice to the problem because the dataset have more than one type of data. The output is a simple boolean answer (will fail or won't fail) which makes this model even more compatible to the problem.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2) KNN\n",
    "    In [3], Bijalman et al say that K-Nearest-Neighbors can be used on the Text Categorization (TC), aka Text Classification problem. A problem which classifies documents into different categories.\n",
    "    As advatages of KNN we have: simplicity. \n",
    "        \n",
    "    Some of the disadvantages are: high \n",
    "    In my opinion, KNN is a good choosing of model because \n",
    "    \n",
    "3) SVM\n",
    "    Baccarini et al say in [2] that a large percentage of the total induction motor failures are due to mechanical faults and that Support Vector Machines (SVM) can be used to help diagnose these failures.\n",

    "In this final section, you will choose from the three supervised learning models the *best* model to use on the student data. You will then perform a grid search optimization for the model over the entire training set (`X_train` and `y_train`) by tuning at least one parameter to improve upon the untuned model's F<sub>1</sub> score.

    "\n",
    "    Based on the experiments performed, we can see that KNN and SVM had similar responsed with SVM having a better F1 score for both train and test sets. Even though the training time for SVM is higher than the KNN training time, for this chosen set, I think it is worth it. We can see that for 300 samples, the time is almost 6 times greater but it is also less than 1/100 of seconds, which is considerably fast for human parameters, so I think, in this case, it is worth to have a better F1 score in expense of time."

Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction. Avoid using advanced mathematical or technical jargon, such as describing equations or discussing the algorithm implementation.*"

    "    The chosen model was the Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a model that tries to find a division (called as hyperplanes) that divides the categories where the margins are maximized. Margin is the distance between that hyperplane and the points of labeled data. Let's take a look at the following image:\n",
    "    \n",
    "![optimal-hyperplane.png](attachment:optimal-hyperplane.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    We can see in that image examples of data separated between two categories (blue and red). We could have a great amount of hyperplanes in that case that could separate the data and still have the same training accuracy. By trying to maximize the margins, it generalizes more so the model doesn't only memorizes things (overfit) because that would possibly (and probably) make the model classify some new data points wrongly. For example, it could predict that a student wouldn't fail when it was supposed to predict that that student would fail (False Negative). That would be a problem because the actions that could be of any help for this student would not be done.\n",

    "    By using Grid Search we achieved the following F1 scores: 0.9735 for training and 0.8077 for testing. We can see that the F1 score for trainig went up considerably but the testing F1 score didn't change so much. We can also see that the prediction time went up but only by 0.0002 seconds for the testing set. As we had better results for F1 score and the training and testing times didn't change in a really relevant way, I would choose the tuned model to be used in this problem."
